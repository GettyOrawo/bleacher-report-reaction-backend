To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

  I enjoyed doing the codetest, quite challenging but was up to the task. Thanks for the opportunity!
